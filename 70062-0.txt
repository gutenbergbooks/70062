DISSERTATION concluded.


At the commencement of this Monograph the extent of this elegant tribe
of plants appeared to be circumscribed within a small compass, and we
calculated upon one volume enshrining the whole Genus. The termination
of that volume left a residuum of sufficient magnitude to complete a
second, at whose termination an ample fund for continuation was still
apparent. A third is finished; and there yet remains enough to form a
fourth, the conclusion of which will, we think, contain all that are as
yet in cultivation with us, as the limits of this extensive family
appear at present to be bounded within three hundred species and
distinct varieties; and unless some new source should be found to extend
it, by the discovery of some unexpected mine of novelty, it may be then
considered as for a time completed; although, no doubt, from the
beautiful variations occasionally raised from seed, there will be still
further accessions of novelty to merit attention at some future period,
by way of appendix.

When the author first began to delineate the Erica family in the year
1794, the greater part of the species then known had been so recently
imported, that the seeds did not ripen with us. A period of fifteen
years having since elapsed, many of them have become so far naturalized
as to perfect their seed freely. The prevalent idea of their not
ripening with us is owing to a want of sufficient attention to preserve
them; for, as soon as the seeds are perfect, if not immediately
collected, the capsule splits, and the seeds, which are extremely small,
escape unperceived.

The fourth volume will contain, in addition to each figure, a short
account of who first raised it, &c., and at the end of the volume (which
the author trusts will be completed in much less time than the foregoing
ones) all the seeds that can possibly be procured will be represented,
both of the natural size and magnified, to render the work as complete
as the progressive increase of the vegetable kingdom will possibly admit
of.
